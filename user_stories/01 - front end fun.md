Spend an hour or so and just play with the styling of the front-end.

You can add or change CSS, get to know tailwind, or if you are feeling comfortable with that, add some javascript bling.

If you aren't a designer don't worry the point is just to play around.

Check out the tailwind playground if you haven't:
