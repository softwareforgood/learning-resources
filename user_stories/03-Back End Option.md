If you made it all the way here and have books with reviews, congratulations!

For the next exercise you can pick whether you want a back-end focus, a front-end focus, or both.

Backend Story

* You just got word that you are acquiring a competitor and you will be able to load in all of their books and reviews. They told you they can give it to you in a CSV. How do you want the CSV to look and can you write a rake task to parse it, and create books and reviews from it?

or

* You just got word that you are signing a customer that wants to use your reviews on their site. Create an API endpoint that returns JSON that lets you send in a book ID (we can figure out how to query for that ID later) and retrieve all of it's reviews as an array
